This repository contains the source code, dataset, and model results used in the study: “Prediction of pull-out behavior of timber glued-in glass fiber reinforced polymer and steel rods under various environmental conditions based on ANN and GEP models.”

# **Overview**

Glued-in rod (GIR) connections are widely used in timber construction for both retrofitting and new structures. Their performance, however, is significantly affected by environmental conditions. This study leverages two soft computing techniques—Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP)—to predict:

Ultimate load-bearing capacity

Free-end slip

for timber connections with GFRP and steel rods under normal and harsh (e.g., seawater exposure) environmental conditions.

# **Contents**

Data: Preprocessed experimental dataset.
